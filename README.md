Model to create inspirational quotes

This is part of a 3 part project to build a ML model to generate insprational quotes. The second phase is to build an API and then push the quotes to the API if they are classed as good.  The final part is a project to pull quotes from the API and display an image that is relevant to the quote.

For this project I have fine tuned GPT2 using gpt_2_simple and loaded the full model in LFS due to the size.
